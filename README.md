## Project Description

This project explores how different machine learning and statistical methods can
be applied to real-time cryptocurrency price data.

The goal is to find relationships, detect significant price anomalies, and
classify short-term trends in Bitcoin and other major digital assets.

The work combines high-frequency data from [Blocklink Lake](https://lake.blocklink.cloud/) with practical data mining techniques to build a foundation for smarter digital
asset analysis.

## Questions Sought to Answer

* How are cryptocurrency prices correlated with each other?
* Can we detect sudden, unusual changes in Bitcon prices?
* Can we classify short-term price trends as bullish or bearish using an LSTM
model?

## Key Findings

* Bitcoin and Ethereum showed a strong positive price correlation, while Bitcon
and XRP had a weak correlation.
* Using a Z-score method based on rolling median, 183 Bitcoin price anomalies
were detected over a 3-day period.
* A simlple LSTM model was able to classify short-term trends with around 63%
accuracy, showing stronger performance in prediction bullish movements.

## Application of Knowledge

* Correlation analysis can help investors diversify thie crypto portfolios more
intelligently.
* Anomaly detection techiques can support early warning systems for risk
management and trading alerts.
* Trend classification models can serve as building blocks for algorithmic
trading strategies, helping traders anticpate market direction.
